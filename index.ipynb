    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This final project focused on <i>sentiment analysis</i>, more specifically, classifying a given text (tweet in this case) as carrying a \"positive\" emotion or a \"negative\" emotion. For the purpose of this classification, this project wrote and implemented the PEGASOS algorithm to solve the primal formulation of SVMs (Support Vector Machines). The primal formulation of SVM is a convex optimization problem that aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates the classes in a binary classification task. Furthermore, this  project dealt with the vectorization of text-based data, and the parameters which affect how text is stored in a way a machine learning model can understand. Through hyperparameter tuning, this project was able to arrive at a $72$% accuracy on the <i>testing data</i> in predicting the emotion of a text (positive or negative). The limitation of the model created in this project is that it follows a \"bag-of-words\" approach - therefore, this model does not understand the \"contextual\" meaning of words.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is an evergrowing field with applications in many areas like analyzing customer feedback, social media monitoring, and so on. However, the primary purpose for this project was to create a sentiment analyis model which can discern \"positive\" tweets from \"negative\" tweets. Although, the data set used was the twitter data set, this problem is not limited to that. Having a model which can discern \"positive\" emotions from \"negative\" emotions (represented through text) can be really helpful in diagnosing and help people who might be suffering from mental health issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, the model was a binary classifier. This is because the data set which contained the tweets only had two annotations: (0) negative, and (4) positive. However, there have been other works where the range of annotations is higher - very (negative/positive), slightly (negative/positive), and neutral. This multi-class classification might lead to a more nuanced model which can better understand the emotion of a text [@MulticlassSVM]. Furthermore, there have also been research in which the SVM has been trained on data from multiple sources, and there has been use of uni-grams and bi-grams in the model. This project will aim to borrow some ideas from this paper, particularly, the use of unigram and bigrams in the term-document matrix [@unigram]. Lastly, there has also been research which inspired future work I could do in this project, including emoticons in the analysis of sentiment of tweets [@SentimentDistantSupervision]."

    "# Values Statement\n",
    "The main idea behind this project was to come up with a machine learning model which can potentially be used to intervene and assist people in need of mental health support. Although, one major drawback of this model is that it does not understand the contextual meaning of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am not particularly sure how this project would be implemented - given that implementing a model which analyzes \"text\" written by someone can be considered a breach of privacy. However, the potential users for this project could be mental health experts, who want to leverage the power of technology to get a better understanding of people (patients) who visit them. This model will benefit in the diagnosis of people who are suffering from mental health issues and allow intervention. Although this project does not directly harm anyone, the fact that it is trained over a data set which contained tweets in English means that anyone who does not know English is actively excluded from the benefits of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am really interested in learning about and applying technological solutions which can solve real-life social issues. Due to this, I was really interested in applying my knowledge of machine learning in creating something which could potentially benefit other people. Based on my reflection, if my model had a higher accuracy rate, and if it were implemented respecting an individual's privacy - my model would make the world a more <i>joyful</i> place!"

    "# Materials and Methods\n",
    "The data set chosen for this project is called the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140?datasetId=2477\">Sentiment140</a> data set, which contains $1.6$ million tweets, which are annotated as Negative (0) and Positive (4). Each row of this data set contains information for a tweet: Sentiment, Tweet ID, Time of Tweet, Username, Tweet, and so on. A potential limitation of this data set is that it only contains tweets which were written in English, therefore, this model excludes people who speak other languages. The chosen model to train this data on was SVM, although, the main question was between: the <i>Primal</i> form of SVM, and the <i>Dual</i> form of SVM. Since we are dealing with linearly separable data, with fewer features compared to samples - the choice was <i>Primal SVM</i>. The <i>Dual</i> form of SVM, would have proven to be very computationally expensive, especially because of the construction of the <i>kernel</i>!\n",

    "# Personal Reflection\n",
    "Personally, I found the process of working on this project very enriching. This class has always been very hands-on, and working on this project was an extension of that. Through this project, I got acquainted with the workflow which is followed in a machine learning project. This was a good exercise to both get the data ready for the machine learning model (identifying and understanding the data set, and then vectorizing it), and to be able to read literature and scholarly papers and translate the math into code. Furthermore, this project made me appreciate the value of writing optimized code and choosing the right models - which do not cause heavy computational pressure on the device. I felt this when I was trying to work with the <i>Dual</i> form of SVM - which required the creation of a really large <i>kernel matrix</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, this project definitely has room for improvement, especially with the existence of models which can understand words contextually and discern sarcam from true emotions. However, I am satisfied with my findings in this project, and I feel that I met my goals just right (did not exceed them, and did not fall too short). One goal which I could not meet was uploading this model on a web-app, however, that was an extended goal and I aim to do that soon in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project definitely improved my ability to research machine learning topics, and to teach myself things. Therefore, this experience will definitely help me in my future courses and career. This is because tech is constantly evolving, and to learn new things, you have to be able to teach yourself.\n"
